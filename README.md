# Brewster

   Brewster is an application for finding new beers, seeing each beer's detailed information, and keeping track of all your favorites! Users can leave reviews on each beer so that others can make good decisions about which beers to try and share opinions! The app was built with a custom Rails API in conjunction with an external beer API for the backend. On the frontend, we used React, HTML5, and CSS3.

 Designed and built by: Andrew Allen, Romy Maghsoudi, and Will Jones.
